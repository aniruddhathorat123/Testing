Robolectric:

 - No need of real device for test execution.
 - Gives more realstic expericen when test calls into the android framework.
 - Robolectric handles inflation of views, resource loading, and lots of other stuff thatâ€™s implemented in native C code on Android devices.

 1. Shadows:
  - Each shadow can modify or extend the behavior of a corresponding class in the Android OS.
  - Shadow classes always need a public no-arg constructor so that the Robolectric framework can instantiate them.
  - Shadow objects implement methods that have the same signature as the Android class.
  - Robolectric will invoke the method on a Shadow object when a method with the same signature on the Android object is invoked.
